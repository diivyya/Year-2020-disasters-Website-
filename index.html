          <p class="text-small">
            Let's face what lies ahead with open eyes: 2020 is going to be a very tough year for the world, and developing countries in particular. 
            January 1, 2020 marked the beginning of a brand-new decade that many looked at with optimism and as a chance at a new lease on life. But as the year approaches its half way point, many are wondering if this year can get any worse.

        <p class="text-small">The Australian state of New South Wales has declared a state of emergency and could begin forced evacuations from fire-stricken areas, as emergency crews battle deadly blazes and brace for a dangerous weekend ahead.

          State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said Thursday that the emergency declaration would come into effect Friday morning as weather conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly on Saturday, raising the fire danger even further.
          <br>This is the third time NSW has declared a state of emergency in as many months -- the last two times, in November and December, were also for seven days, and granted extraordinary powers to the Rural Fire Service.
          <br>Berejiklian said residents could also be subject to forced evacuations, road closures and any other means necessary to keep people safe.
          <br>"We want to make sure we are taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday," she said.

        <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" class="text-big">January 7: The World Health Organization is notified of the novel coronavirus, then known as 2019-nCoV, in China.</a>
        <p class="text-small">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
          <br>
          Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
          <br>
          The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
          <br>
          The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
          <br>
          At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

        <p class="text-small">Massive protests swept the US in late May and early June following the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, splitting opinion in an already deeply polarized country.
           <br>
          While many in both the US and abroad celebrated the protests as mainly peaceful and saw them as an opportunity for much-needed police reform, critics have pointed to violence between the police and protesters, as well as some looting, as evidence that law and order had been lost. While Democrats took the knee in a gesture of solidarity with protesters, US President Donald Trump railed against left-wing group Antifa and others and reportedly wanted to send in 10,000 US troops to clear the streets.
          <br>
          In mid-June, protesters came under a series of attacks, including a man who drove his car into a crowd in Seattle.
          With protests ongoing, the gulf between both sides appears to be only growing ahead of the November 2020 presidential election.
A similar dynamic can be found in European countries such as the UK, where Black Lives Matters protesters are also protesting against racial injustice and police brutality.

      <p class="text-small">Rainfall that accompanies Asia’s summer monsoon plays an important role in the region’s economy by refilling aquifers, generating hydroelectric energy, and providing water for crops. In some years, however, the amount of rainfall breaks records in places. That has been the case in 2020. 
        <br>By mid-July, severe flooding affected millions of people across South and East Asia.

        <br>This map shows the rainfall accumulation across the region from June 1 (the start of the summer monsoon season) to July 20, 2020. The data are remotely-sensed estimates that come from the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), a product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. The darkest reds indicate places where GPM detected rainfall totals exceeding 100 centimeters (40 inches) during this period. Due to averaging of the satellite data, local rainfall amounts may be significantly higher when measured from the ground.
        
        <br> Note the particularly high rainfall totals across India. According to the World Meteorological Organization, many parts of central, north, and northeast India had received 15 centimeters (6 inches) more rainfall than usual by the middle of July. The northeast Indian state of Assam, for example, had received a total of 89 centimeters (35 inches) of rain between June 1 and July 22, about 20 percent more than normal. The rainfall spurred deadly flooding that cut off villages and displaced thousands of people. There were also reports of animals—including rare one-horned rhinos—that drowned when water levels rose in Assam’s Kaziranga National Park.
